# DevNetKeyboard

This is a dirty hack, and it knows it...

Open a terminal on the CentOS workstation, and paste this into the commandline (Right-click -> Paste)

```bash
wget -O - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swiatecki/DevNetKeyboard/master/dk_key.sh" | sudo sh 
```


Tested on:

* OSX with MS RDP app
