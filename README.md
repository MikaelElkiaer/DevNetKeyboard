# DevNetKeyboard

Open a terminal on the CentOS workstation, and paste this into the commandline (Right-click -> Paste)


```bash
wget -O - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swiatecki/DevNetKeyboard/master/nicer_dk_key.sh" | sudo sh
```

Tested on:

* OSX with MS RDP app

This one is a dirty hack, and it knows it:

**Do not use this one**

```bash
wget -O - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swiatecki/DevNetKeyboard/master/dk_key.sh" | sudo sh 
```
